# header_utils

A collection of header-only C++20 "libraries" that implement small but useful utilities.

**This is in-progress, live-at-head code that most likely has a lot of bugs, was not thoroughly tested, and requires C++20** (or at least, the version of C++20 that MSVC supports, did not test other compilers, though the code should be portable).

**Pull requests welcome!**

### Note on portability

Since this is a C++20 library, and apparently no compiler except MSVC supports C++20 fully, don't expect it to work anywhere other than MSVC. Yay.
